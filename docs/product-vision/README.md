# Product vision — consolidated spec

This folder holds the **single place** to read the **current** product direction without wading through the full Q&A trail in `docs/planning/`.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **[SPEC.md](./SPEC.md)** | **Consolidated** vision: **§0 coherent spine**, then pipeline, rules, risks, links to deep planning. **Start here.** |
| **[ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)** | **Logical** diagram: workspace, indexer, RAW store, diff, overlay, API, UI, agent, validation — must match **SPEC §0–§9**. |
| **[ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md)** | **Full development phases** (0–8): order of work so the build stays on vision; **AI & tool hosts** (MCP + HTTP, solo v1); detail per phase when you start it. |
| **[goal.md](./goal.md)** | Narrative **why**: bridge human intent ↔ AI execution (map + anchors). |
| **[v1-strategy.md](./v1-strategy.md)** | **v1 architectural decision**: shared Python spine, **in-house graph shell first**, optional MCP/IDE **after**; **next steps** (bundle → API → UI → model → adapters). |

## Relationship to other docs

- **`docs/planning/brainstorming.md`** — Full conversation-derived detail, section numbers (§8, §9, §10…), session logs, and explorations that didn’t make the cut.
- **`docs/planning/audience.md`** — Who / JTBD; **`idea.md`** — **elevator + paragraph pitch**, promises, non-goals, differentiation (**draft**, same spine as SPEC); **`how-to-use.md`** — **first-session / workflows / glossary**; **SPEC.md** remains the **invariant** summary and technical consolidation.

## Repo layout reminder

- **`poc-brainstorm-ui/`** — Throwaway **visual** POC (React Flow); not the product.

## Changelog

| Date | Note |
